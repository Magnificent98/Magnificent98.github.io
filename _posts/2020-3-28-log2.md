Refreshed the homepage.<br/><br/>
No longer a construction site, this blog is about to open.<br/><br/>
What is it for? Mainly study logs. I found that one good way to make sure that you master something, is to write it down and post it out. You have to make sure everything you wrote is logical and precise, or else it would be very embarrassing.<br/><br/>
Besides, I can practice my english writing :)<br/><br/>
Let's get started. Hopefully one day, this blog can be popular~<br/><br/>
