<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After several days of struggling, I chopped my hand. I have to say it hurts, and hurt me really bad. However, I've also got a longlasting pleasure.</p><br/>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the past few days, I lived in such a dilemma that if I don't that, I will not fall asleep. So in the late night I was sitting there, contemplating the meaning of life. Was money more important or the pleasure of life? However, when I explained the predicament I was in to one of my friends, he encouraged me to follow my heart and just move on. Then, after another few days of toss and turn, I made my decision. I AM GOING TO DO THAT. </p><br/>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So at that dark and windy night, I opened my shopping app and bought this 1500+ pcs of CaDa building block. </p><br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a super fan of Minecraft, I believe that I have a natural love for blocks. Little things together that make a big difference. I used to have several Lego building blocks, but this one's scale is far beyond any of them. Look at that 1580 pcs of building block and 140 pages of guidebook! Both of them give me an excitment that beyond description. What's more, as a model of endurance race car, I can literally assemble its engine and suspension system! You just can't imagine how alluring that is to a mechanic fancier. I also bought the power module which means that I can make the race car a remote driven one. I started the assemble as soon as it arrived.</p><br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I made it after two days of hard working. It's not that difficult with a guidebook, but hand-consuming. My thumb still hurts now. Here's the result. Tada </p><br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Judging from the apperance, I have to say it's cool. The black and silver and white body, with few pieces of eye-catching red paints. The door and the back lid can be unfolded and respond to remote control. The steering wheel in the cockpit is connected to the front suspension system and the headlights can be switched on. Back to the blocks, they are in very good conditions and are not inferior to Lego blocks. I made a few mistakes but were able to correct them depending on the reliable quality of the block. So I believe that the price I paid is worthwhile. However, there is one big problem that bothers me. The chassis of the car is way too low that few pieces in the front touch the ground. I don't know if this is a common problem. But judging from the price, I'll take it. </p><br/>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, this is my first experience on a "huge" building block project, and I quite like it. And I'm looking forward to a second one, when I have enough money (hand) to spend (chop).</p><br/>
